# Spatial Omics Course

Welcome to the Spatial Transcriptomics part of our Single-cell and Spatial Omics Data Analysis course.
This course is part of the [Single-Cell and Spatial Omics Symposium 2026](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/hilife-helsinki-institute-life-science/units/fimm/training-fimm/overview-doctoral-training/single-cell-and-spatial-omics-course-2026/single-cell-and-spatial-omics-symposium-2026) organized by the Helsinki Institute of Life Science (HiLife) at the University of Helsinki (UH).

In this part of the course, we will introduce you to the foundations of spatial transcriptomics (ST) data analysis for sequence- and image-based ST.
This site provides all the code with exercises and solutions, along with conceptual explanations for the methods used.
